LLMs in medicine are nowadays super in hype.
Or better, GenAI is super in hype. The last one is different from traditional AI in that it can generate content, such as summaries of text and answers to questions, rather than merely analyzing existing data. 
GenAI can definitively improve your work as healthcare professional since the goal is just to "removing the robot that is inside you to let you perform more human related task". 
Hence the opportunity here of GenAI is just to manage exactly all the jobs that as healthcare professional you try to avoid every day to let you as much time as possible with patients. 
This since GenAI can empower your role, plus the patients to take a more active role in their healthcare. This since patients can use LLM-powered chatbots to interact with their EHR, prepare for appointments.

While challenges exist, the benefits of GenAI are too significant to ignore, and it may revolutionize care delivery by automating tasks, improving patient self-management, and enhancing job satisfaction. 

By actively engaging in the development and implementation of GenAI, and adopting a balanced approach that prioritizes safety and responsibility, we can explore its potential to transform the way we deliver cardiovascular care and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

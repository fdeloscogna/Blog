If you are reading this it means that we have already something in common, since like you Iâ€™m a curious person. Learning new topics is the best journey to share especially if it can improve healthcare. To contribute in health challenges I work as a healthcare data analyst and what I find astonishing about the data world is that you can exchange ideas with different experts and understand a bit more of their needs and worldview. It is easy to find me in workshops or seminars and among them, speak with the authors and participants to gain new ideas, especially to raise new questions. This since sharing ideas and having a chance for new discussion is the learning path that I prefer. Finally, I care a lot about relationships, especially at work, because I believe that an excellent work environment is the key to giving our best.

If you are reading this it means that we have already something in common, since like you Iâ€™m a curious person. Learning new topics is the best journey to share especially if it can improve healthcare. To contribute in health challenges I work as a healthcare data analyst and what I find astonishing about the data world is that you can exchange ideas with different experts and understand a bit more of their needs and worldview. It is easy to find me in workshops or seminars and among them, speak with the authors and participants to gain new ideas, especially to raise new questions. This since sharing ideas and having a chance for new discussion is the learning path that I prefer. Finally, I care a lot about relationships, especially at work, because I believe that an excellent work environment is the key to giving our best.

Abstract:
:::

New Statistical and Deep learning emthods, in the wide public, are commonly linked to "big data" scenario. However, especially in healthcare, collecting and annotating large data sets can be very time-consuming and too expensive. In addition, because of the huge and strict regulation that envelops such personal and sensitive data, it's uncommon also to find freely available datasets online. Such boundaries, leads the data professional with a very narrow portfolio of choices mostly when managing predictive models. The challenge deals both with modeling and pre-processing the data since a bad choice in one of these steps can deal with a sub-optimal result with the risk of low-quality decision-making. In addition, low data availability can affect also less complex models in survival analysis when studying a specific disease to discover new patterns to develop new care scenarios, then there is a low probability of finding additional data to compare and validate such phenomenon. Given the data challenge, the manuscript explores the phenomenon theoretically and empirically by conducting two main experiments considering classical statistical methods and deep learning solutions like transfer learning capable of solving tasks in cross-domain knowledge. The thesis underlines how these algorithms behave when dealing with fragmented, structured, and unstructured data created by healthcare systems. The work highlights that despite the scarcity of data available, embracing data science in healthcare can provide practical insights for physicians boosting healthcare quality and evidence-based medicine.
